## The representational architecture of fast learning through abstraction

Part of the perceptual knowledge we acquire in everyday life does not rely on repeated exposure or training: a single significant event can induce robust changes on brain activity and behavior. Such one-shot perceptual learning emerges during development in parallel to incremental learning and plays a crucial role when evidence is scarce or ambiguous. However, while most cognitive neuroscientists agree on its relevance to our adaptation abilities, the neural and cognitive computations driving one-shot learning remain largely unknown.
 
Predictive processing accounts have been very influential in the study of one-shot perceptual learning. From this perspective, significant perceptual episodes create lingering traces in the brain, reflecting internal models of the external world, or priors. Priors are proposed to then inform downstream brain regions about the causes of sensory input. Although this framework offers an intuitive explanation of the procedures that might support one-shot perceptual learning, we currently lack an optimal description of the precise nature of priors and the information they contain.
 
The overall aim of FLARE is to provide fundamental insights into how internal models of single perceptual events are instantiated in patterns of brain activity. FLARE constitutes a novel approach combining the PI’s theoretical background and expertise in cutting-edge neuroimaging methods that will allow us to pursue the overall objective across two experimental series.
 
The project will tackle two major open questions: 1) What is the content of priors of single perceptual events across the brain? And 2) To what extent does one-shot perceptual learning rely on sensory-specific vs. abstract priors of the episode? For both goals, we will employ a combination of tailored behavioral tasks, computational modeling, and neuroimaging methods.
