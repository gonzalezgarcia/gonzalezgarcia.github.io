Hi there! I am a [Ramón y Cajal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Ram%C3%B3n_y_Cajal) fellow at the University of Granada, where I did my PhD with [María Ruz](https://wpd.ugr.es/~humneuro/) and Pío Tudela. Before, I spent some time as a Fulbright scholar in [Biyu He](https://med.nyu.edu/helab/)’s lab at NIH and NYU, and as a Marie Skłodowska-Curie postdoc fellow in Prof. [Marcel Brass](https://www.scienceofintelligence.de/people/marcel-brass/)' lab at Ghent University.



I'm a psychologist often navigating the intersection of cognitive and computational neuroscience. I'm primarily interested in the mechanisms involved in different instances of complex, flexible behavior.
