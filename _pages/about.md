Hi there! I am a cognitive neuroscientist intrigued by how the brain learns and adapts to the complexities of our ever-changing world. My research focuses on the interplay of perception and memory, and more specifically in mechanisms like rapid and/or one-shot learning, where a single experience can significantly reshape our subjective experience of the environment.

During my time as PhD student and postdoc, I was fortunate to work with amazing teams in [Spain](https://wpd.ugr.es/~humneuro/#people), [Belgium](https://www.scienceofintelligence.de/people/marcel-brass/) and the [USA](https://med.nyu.edu/helab/). These experiences shaped my vision on how to ideally approach (computational) cognitive neuroscience: a combination of rigurous experimental control and advanced neuroimaging, aimed at building useful and tractable theories of cognition. Now, as a [Ramón y Cajal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Ram%C3%B3n_y_Cajal) fellow at the University of Granada, I’m excited to lead my own team along this path in the [Human Neuroscience lab](https://wpd.ugr.es/~humneuro/).

In parallel to my primary research, I am interested in analysis and software development, reflecting on mentoring and teaching practices, and engaging in broader debates at the intersection of neuroscience, cognition, and artificial intelligence. I might also fall for one or two time-consuming [fun enterprises](https://gonzalezgarcia.github.io/resources/) every now and then.
