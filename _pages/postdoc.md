## About the Project

[FLARE](https://gonzalezgarcia.github.io/flare/) investigates the neural mechanisms that support one-shot perceptual learning. We focus on how perceptual priors are formed and represented in the brain using **fMRI**, **Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA)**, and **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** models. The project is funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and led by [Carlos González-García](https://gonzalezgarcia.github.io/flare/).

## Position Overview

- **Role:** Postdoctoral Researcher  
- **Research Focus:**  
  - Analysis of **fMRI data** using **RSA**
  - Development and validation of theoretical RSA models using **DNNs**
- **Institution:** University of Granada (Mind, Brain and Behavior Research Center – CIMCYC)  
- **Duration:** 2 years (fully funded)  
- **Gross salary**: ~35,000€/year
- **Start Date:** Flexible (ideally early 2026)  
- **Location:** Granada, Spain



## Requirements

- PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience, Psychology, Computational Neuroscience, or a related field (at the time of appointment)
- Experience with **multivariate methods** (e.g., RSA, MVPA)
- Experience with **DNNs**
- Proficiency in programming (e.g., Python, MATLAB)



## Valuable Skills

- Familiarity with **DNN-based RSA modeling**
- Knowledge of **predictive processing** or **perceptual learning** frameworks
- Experience with **neuroimaging toolkits** (e.g., Nilearn, FSL, SPM)
- Good collaborative and communication skills
- Familiarity with open science practices
