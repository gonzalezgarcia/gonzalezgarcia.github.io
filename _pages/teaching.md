**THINGS-Mooney database**

<img src="/assets/img/output.gif" alt="Output GIF" width="150"/>

The [THINGS-Mooney database](https://github.com/wobc/things-mooney) provides a set of "mooney-style" distorted images (created from the original license-free [THINGS-plus images](https://osf.io/jum2f/)). Additionally, this repository contains a toolbox to create your own mooney-style images, plus subjective recognition scores for each mooney image collected on a large sample of participants (n = 947).

If you use this dataset in your research, please cite this repository as follows:

Linde-Domingo, J.\*, Ortiz-Tudela, J.\*, Voeller, J., & González-García, C. (2024). THINGS-Mooney database (v1.0.0). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14040189

**Prediction Error estimator**

[This notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xLNmZmx8bxxcXoHzcDWZctnG14s1f1BG?usp=sharing) demonstrates a toy model of Prediction Error (PE) estimation.

It visualizes how sensory information, priors, and their precisions interact to form a posterior belief.

The model is based on the principles of Bayesian inference and uses Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to quantify the difference between distributions.
