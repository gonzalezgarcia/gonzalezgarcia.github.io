 abstract = {To successfully perform everyday activities, cognitive functions such as working memory (WM) and selective attention must be triggered. Specifically, when environmental demands are dynamic, exogenous attention is crucial. However, its ability to select and prioritize not only perceptual spatial locations, but also novel stimulus-response (S-R) bindings held in WM remains largely unexplored. By implementing a retro-cueing paradigm on a task that capitalized on WM, the present experiment’s aim was two-fold: i) to evaluate whether cueing effects would not only impact spatial processing but also WM content, and ii) to explore how meta-control states induced by the manipulation of an intervening event (IE) would modulate these effects. We observed (N=50) that exogenous attention not only led to selection of space, as it is usually observed in exogenous attention paradigms, but also the content associated with that location. Moreover, space selection was modulated by the IE manipulation, which was thought to induce two meta-control states (persistent vs. flexible). As such, the presence of the IE also modulated participants’ performance regarding novel vs. repeated stimulus-response mappings, again hinting at an important role of content in this task. This pattern of findings fits well with the concept of event file, a mental representation of all relevant components assembled at the beginning of a trial (i.e., cue, target, lateralization, meta-control state, etc.), which are retrieved together once one or more of its elements are encountered. Although preliminary, this evidence of exogenous attentional selection of WM through event file activation paves the way for a promising research line.},

	abstract= {Human task performance elicits diverse subjective metacognitive experiences, such as boredom, effort, fatigue and frustration, which are thought to play important roles in the monitoring and regulation of cognitive processes. Yet, their specific contributions to task performance remain poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated temporal dynamics between these metacognitive experiences and the cognitive processes supporting task performance. We used a time-on-task design using a conflict Flanker task, and analyzed the data using a multi-methodological approach involving behavioral, model-based, subjective, and neural measures. We show that the temporal dynamics supporting task performance can be understood as a rational attempt to optimize behavior and that distinct metacognitive experiences track distinct aspects of this rational endeavor: frustration signals the need to adapt the decision boundary which is experienced as fatiguing. These findings demonstrate that metacognitive experiences might act as tools for humans to gain insights into the optimality of their cognitive performance.},
