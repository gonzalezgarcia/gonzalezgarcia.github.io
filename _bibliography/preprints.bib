	abstract= {Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, demanding a diverse set of cognitive functions such as attention and working memory (WM) to perform adaptive behaviors. However, exogenous attention, characterized as automatic and involuntary, has primarily been studied by focusing on the spatial domain. In particular, the ability of pure exogenous retro-cues to select and prioritize not only spatial locations, but also novel stimulus-response (S-R) bindings held in WM remains largely unexplored. Here, in two experimental series, we provide evidence that pure exogenous non-predictive retro-cues can select not only space, but also associated S-R bindings held in WM. Additional evidence from a drift-diffusion model hinted at the possibility that the mechanisms through which exogenous attention selects and prioritizes WM contents depend, at least partially, on the hierarchical relevance of the different dimensions encoded within a specific representation. These results highlight the relationship between pure exogenous attention and complex WM contents and shed light on current theoretical debates about the interaction of attention, memory, and action.}

	abstract= {Human task performance elicits diverse subjective metacognitive experiences, such as boredom, effort, fatigue and frustration, which are thought to play important roles in the monitoring and regulation of cognitive processes. Yet, their specific contributions to task performance remain poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated temporal dynamics between these metacognitive experiences and the cognitive processes supporting task performance. We used a time-on-task design using a conflict Flanker task, and analyzed the data using a multi-methodological approach involving behavioral, model-based, subjective, and neural measures. We show that the temporal dynamics supporting task performance can be understood as a rational attempt to optimize behavior and that distinct metacognitive experiences track distinct aspects of this rational endeavor: frustration signals the need to adapt the decision boundary which is experienced as fatiguing. These findings demonstrate that metacognitive experiences might act as tools for humans to gain insights into the optimality of their cognitive performance.}

    pdf={https://psyarxiv.com/skvw6/},
	html = {https://psyarxiv.com/skvw6/},
	abstract= {Retrospective attention is involuntarily or voluntarily oriented to working memory (WM) contents. Previous research has not assessed voluntary attention ruling out the effects of involuntary attention. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the voluntariness of attention impacts differently on perceptual and semantic WM contents. To address this, reaction time and accuracy data from two retro-cueing experiments were modeled with a drift-diffusion model. Surprisingly, the voluntariness of attention did not interact with the WM content type. In turn, drift rates indicated that attention exerted greater retro-cueing effects on perceptual vs. semantic WM contents, and non‐decision times revealed effects only for voluntary attention. This evidences: first, that attention has a stronger impact on the quality of perceptual over semantic contents when they compete for WM storage; second, that voluntariness is crucial for retrieving WM contents in advance of decision-making; finally, the effects of voluntary attention can be independent of involuntary attentional orienting.}
