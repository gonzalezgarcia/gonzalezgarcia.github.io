	abstract= {Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, demanding a diverse set of cognitive functions such as attention and working memory (WM) to perform adaptive behaviors. However, exogenous attention, characterized as automatic and involuntary, has primarily been studied by focusing on the spatial domain. In particular, the ability of pure exogenous retro-cues to select and prioritize not only spatial locations, but also novel stimulus-response (S-R) bindings held in WM remains largely unexplored. Here, in two experimental series, we provide evidence that pure exogenous non-predictive retro-cues can select not only space, but also associated S-R bindings held in WM. Additional evidence from a drift-diffusion model hinted at the possibility that the mechanisms through which exogenous attention selects and prioritizes WM contents depend, at least partially, on the hierarchical relevance of the different dimensions encoded within a specific representation. These results highlight the relationship between pure exogenous attention and complex WM contents and shed light on current theoretical debates about the interaction of attention, memory, and action.}

	abstract = {Instructions allow us to fulfill novel and complex tasks on the first try. This skill has been linked to preparatory brain signals that encode upcoming demands in advance, facilitating novel performance. To deepen insight into these processes, we aimed to explore whether instructions pre-activated task-relevant motoric and perceptual neural states. Critically, we addressed whether these representations anticipated activity patterns guiding overt sensorimotor processing, which could reflect that internally simulating the novel task facilitates the preparation. To do so, we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging data while participants encoded and implemented novel stimulus-response associations. Participants also completed localizer tasks designed to isolate the neural representations of the mappings-relevant motor responses, perceptual consequences, and stimulus categories. Using canonical template tracking, we identified whether and where these sensorimotor representations were pre-activated. We found that response-related templates were encoded in advance in regions linked with action control, entailing not only the instructed responses but also their action effects. This result was particularly robust in primary motor and somatosensory cortices. While, following our predictions, we found a systematic decrease in the irrelevant stimulus templates{\textquoteright} representational strength compared to the relevant ones, this difference was due to below-zero estimates linked to the irrelevant category activity patterns. Overall, our findings reflect that instruction processing relies on the sensorimotor cortices to anticipate motoric and kinesthetic representations of prospective action plans, suggesting the engagement of motor imagery during novel task preparation. More generally, they stress that the somatomotor system could participate with higher-level frontoparietal regions during anticipatory task control.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract= {Human task performance elicits diverse subjective metacognitive experiences, such as boredom, effort, fatigue and frustration, which are thought to play important roles in the monitoring and regulation of cognitive processes. Yet, their specific contributions to task performance remain poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated temporal dynamics between these metacognitive experiences and the cognitive processes supporting task performance. We used a time-on-task design using a conflict Flanker task, and analyzed the data using a multi-methodological approach involving behavioral, model-based, subjective, and neural measures. We show that the temporal dynamics supporting task performance can be understood as a rational attempt to optimize behavior and that distinct metacognitive experiences track distinct aspects of this rational endeavor: frustration signals the need to adapt the decision boundary which is experienced as fatiguing. These findings demonstrate that metacognitive experiences might act as tools for humans to gain insights into the optimality of their cognitive performance.}

	abstract= {Retrospective attention is involuntarily or voluntarily oriented to working memory (WM) contents. Previous research has not assessed voluntary attention ruling out the effects of involuntary attention. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the voluntariness of attention impacts differently on perceptual and semantic WM contents. To address this, reaction time and accuracy data from two retro-cueing experiments were modeled with a drift-diffusion model. Surprisingly, the voluntariness of attention did not interact with the WM content type. In turn, drift rates indicated that attention exerted greater retro-cueing effects on perceptual vs. semantic WM contents, and non‐decision times revealed effects only for voluntary attention. This evidences: first, that attention has a stronger impact on the quality of perceptual over semantic contents when they compete for WM storage; second, that voluntariness is crucial for retrieving WM contents in advance of decision-making; finally, the effects of voluntary attention can be independent of involuntary attentional orienting.}

	abstract= {Information in working memory (WM) is crucial for guiding behavior. However, not all WM representations are equally relevant simultaneously. Current theoretical frameworks propose a functional dissociation between ‘latent’ and ‘active’ states, in which relevant representations are prioritized into an optimal (active) state to face current demands, while relevant information that is not immediately needed is maintained in a dormant (latent) state. In this context, task demands can induce rapid and flexible prioritization of information from latent to active state. Critically, these functional states have been primarily studied using simple visual memories, with attention selecting and prioritizing relevant representations to serve as templates to guide subsequent behavior. It remains unclear whether more complex WM representations, such as novel stimulus-response associations, can also be prioritized into different functional states depending on their task relevance, and if so how these different formats relate to each other. In the present study, we investigated whether novel WM-guided actions can be brought into different functional states depending on current task demands. Our results reveal that planned actions can be flexibly prioritized when needed and show how their functional state modulates their influence on ongoing behavior. Moreover, they suggest the representations of novel actions of different functional states are maintained in WM via a non-orthogonal coding scheme, thus are prone to interference.}
