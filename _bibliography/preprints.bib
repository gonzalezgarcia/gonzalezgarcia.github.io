	abstract = {While attention is known to prioritize stimuli held temporally in our working memory (WM), it remains poorly understood how different features (and primarily, spatial vs. non-spatial) involuntarily select complex WM contents to guide action. Building on the Binding and Retrieval in Action Control (BRAC) framework and the Theory of Event Coding (TEC), we hypothesized that any encoded feature should be capable of reactivating an Stimulus-Response (S-R) event file in WM. Across six experiments (N=199), divided into two Experimental Series—in which we systematically manipulated timing, perceptual salience, and attentional engagement—we pre-registered and tested the hypothesis that non-predictive, color-based retro-cues could involuntarily select and prioritize complex WM events associated with S-R bindings. Contrary to our expectations, we found no significant involuntary (facilitatory) effect of color retro-cues and observed moderate meta-analytic evidence against such an effect. This comprehensive lack of an effect stands in stark contrast to meta-analytic evidence from previous studies using the exact same design but with spatial retro-cues, which demonstrated a small but robust effect. This provides compelling evidence that not all retro-cues can interact with WM representations with the same efficacy, challenging the assumption that all features hold equal status within an event representation. Instead, our findings suggest a critical bias in involuntary WM selection: color-based retro-cues fail to involuntarily select complex WM contents containing integrated S-R associations, while spatial retro-cues do. This distinction implies that the functional relevance of a perceptual feature to action planning is the critical determinant for its ability to trigger the prioritization of complex internal representations, upholding the essential link between action and memory in adaptive behavior.},

	abstract = {Selective attention is often divided into voluntary (goal-directed) and involuntary (stimulus-driven) forms, a distinction extensively studied for attention to external sensory input. In contrast, internal selective attention{\textemdash}directed toward representations held in working memory (WM){\textemdash}has been considered primarily for voluntary influences. Recent behavioral evidence suggests that task-irrelevant external stimuli can also influence internal selection of feature-matching WM representations involuntarily, yet the neural mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Here, we tested whether an uninformative exogenous spatial retro-cue presented during a WM delay can act as a selective "ping" and reactivate spatially matching WM content at the level of its representational category. Male and female human participants memorized complex contents presented at distinct locations, followed by unpredictive and task-irrelevant spatial retro-cues that conveyed no category information. Using temporally resolved multivariate EEG decoding, we observed category-specific reactivation of spatially matching WM representations following these cues, providing direct neural evidence for stimulus-driven, involuntary attentional selection within WM, ahead of the memory test. Moreover, neural responses to the subsequent memory-probe were also modulated by cue congruency, consistent with the notion that exogenous influences begin early during sensory processing while also shaping later decision-related processes. Finally, drift-diffusion model analyses revealed that this involuntary cueing effect was primarily driven by increased evidence accumulation. Together, these findings illuminate the mechanisms by which external events can automatically and involuntarily penetrate the internal cognitive workspace.},

  abstract = {Attention shapes how different types of information are maintained and retrieved from working memory (WM). Previous research examined whether the voluntariness of attention interacts with the type of content in WM using central arrow retro-cues, but found no such interaction. However, central and peripheral cues engage attention through different mechanisms: evidence from external attention shows that peripheral cues are more effective in triggering automatic orienting. Determining whether this distinction influences how attention modulates perceptual and semantic WM contents is essential for clarifying how voluntary and involuntary mechanisms operate on internal representations. In this pre-registered study, 100 participants completed two retro-cueing tasks in which peripheral retro-cues directed voluntary or involuntary attention toward perceptual (gray vs. sepia colors) and semantic (natural vs. artificial categories) features of real-world stimuli competing in WM. Reaction time and accuracy were analyzed using hierarchical drift-diffusion models. Results showed, first, that attentional voluntariness did not differentially affect perceptual vs. semantic WM contents, replicating a previous finding. Second, drift rates revealed retro-cueing effects for both voluntary and involuntary attention: voluntary attention produced stronger effects, primarily driven by costs, whereas involuntary attention yielded smaller effects, mainly driven by benefits. Third, non-decision times showed a similar pattern—larger effects (benefits and costs) for voluntary attention, and smaller, benefit-based effects for involuntary attention. Crucially, this involuntary modulation contrasts with previous findings using central retro-cues, where no such effect was observed. Together, these findings suggest that, prior to decision making, peripheral spatial retro-cues more effectively recruit involuntary attention, automatically reactivating WM representations when cue locations overlap with memoranda. Moreover, the results strengthen the view that voluntariness does not interact with the type of WM content when perceptual and semantic features compete for representation.},

	abstract = {Prior work has shown that control brain regions encode upcoming novel instructed actions. Similarly, visual working memory (WM) representations can reflect different priority states. However, it remains unknown whether the priority status of WM-guided novel actions similarly modulates their neural coding format, and how such dynamics unfold over time. We addressed these questions using EEG while human participants performed two consecutive choice reaction tasks. At the start of each trial, participants encoded two novel stimulus-response (S-R) mappings. A cue then indicated whether these mappings would be relevant immediately ("current" condition), later after an intervening task ("prospective"), or after a free delay ("delayed"). Using multivariate pattern analysis, we found that the S-R category was decodable in all conditions during relevant time windows. Critically, pattern similarity analyses revealed that while mere maintenance demands allow for temporary preservation of neural codes (i.e., between current and delayed trials), shielding from interference (i.e., prospective trials) induced significant alterations to the neural code. Further exploration of the representational geometry revealed that priority status gained prominence dynamically over S-R category coding when preparing for such shielding demands. Importantly, some of these changes emerged anticipatorily, prior to target onset. Overall, our results show that, similar to visual WM, the priority of intended actions dynamically and anticipatorily reshapes their neural format. They further reveal how different demands induce content geometries compatible with previously proposed coding schemes, and that such representational changes can be implemented flexibly in time.},

  abstract = {Visual inputs during natural perception are highly ambiguous: objects are frequently occluded, lighting conditions vary, and object identification depends significantly on prior experiences. However, why do certain images remain unidentifiable while others can be recognized immediately, and what visual features drive subjective clarification? To address these critical questions, we developed a unique dataset of 1,854 ambiguous images and collected more than 100,000 participant ratings evaluating their identifiability before and after seeing undistorted versions of the images. Relating the representations of a brain-inspired neural network model in response to our images with human ratings, we show that subjective identification depends largely on the extent to which higher-level visual features from the original images are preserved in their ambiguous counterparts. Notably, the predominance of higher-level features over lower-level ones softens after participants disambiguate the images. In line with these results, an image-level regression analysis showed that the subjective identification of ambiguous images was best explained by high-level visual dimensions. Moreover, we found that the process of ambiguity resolution was accompanied by a notable decrease in semantic distance and a greater consistency in object naming among participants. However, the relationship between information gained after disambiguation and subjective identification was non-linear, indicating that acquiring more information does not necessarily enhance subjective clarity. Instead, we observed a U-shaped relationship, suggesting that subjective identification improves when the acquired information either strongly matches or mismatches prior predictions. Collectively, these findings highlight fundamental principles underlying the mapping between human visual perception and memory, advancing our understanding on how we resolve ambiguity and extract meaning from incomplete visual information.},
