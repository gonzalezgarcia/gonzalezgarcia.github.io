	abstract= {Retrospective attention is involuntarily or voluntarily oriented to working memory (WM) contents. Previous research has not assessed voluntary attention ruling out the effects of involuntary attention. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the voluntariness of attention impacts differently on perceptual and semantic WM contents. To address this, reaction time and accuracy data from two retro-cueing experiments were modeled with a drift-diffusion model. Surprisingly, the voluntariness of attention did not interact with the WM content type. In turn, drift rates indicated that attention exerted greater retro-cueing effects on perceptual vs. semantic WM contents, and non‐decision times revealed effects only for voluntary attention. This evidences: first, that attention has a stronger impact on the quality of perceptual over semantic contents when they compete for WM storage; second, that voluntariness is crucial for retrieving WM contents in advance of decision-making; finally, the effects of voluntary attention can be independent of involuntary attentional orienting.}

	abstract= {Information in working memory (WM) is crucial for guiding behavior. However, not all WM representations are equally relevant simultaneously. Current theoretical frameworks propose a functional dissociation between ‘latent’ and ‘active’ states, in which relevant representations are prioritized into an optimal (active) state to face current demands, while relevant information that is not immediately needed is maintained in a dormant (latent) state. In this context, task demands can induce rapid and flexible prioritization of information from latent to active state. Critically, these functional states have been primarily studied using simple visual memories, with attention selecting and prioritizing relevant representations to serve as templates to guide subsequent behavior. It remains unclear whether more complex WM representations, such as novel stimulus-response associations, can also be prioritized into different functional states depending on their task relevance, and if so how these different formats relate to each other. In the present study, we investigated whether novel WM-guided actions can be brought into different functional states depending on current task demands. Our results reveal that planned actions can be flexibly prioritized when needed and show how their functional state modulates their influence on ongoing behavior. Moreover, they suggest the representations of novel actions of different functional states are maintained in WM via a non-orthogonal coding scheme, thus are prone to interference.}
