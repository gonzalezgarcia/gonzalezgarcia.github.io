Today is a happy day!ü•≥ Our work (the first paper of Chema's PhD!!) comparing **top-down anticipatory representations** in selective **Attention** and **Expectation** finally sees the light!

Being able to anticipate complex environmental information is crucial to achieve efficient behavior. But do we always prepare in the same way? üß†üîÆ
To answer that, **we compared two (apparently) similar cognitive mechanisms**: Selective Attention and Perceptual Expectations.


Selective Attention: is the stimulus **relevant** to my goals?
Perceptual Expectation: is the stimulus **likely** to appear?

We employed a cue-target task while recording EEG from healthy participants. In different blocks, participants had to select or expect faces or names.

<div class="row" style="text-align: center;">
    <div class="col-sm mt-0 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/Fig1_chema.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    
</div>

With Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) we found that **preparation** is a complex phenomenon in which a **cascade of events unfolds**: from bottom-up cue coding, to top-down anticipated stimulus representation.

<div class="row" style="text-align: center;">
    <div class="col-sm mt-0 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/Fig2_chema.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    
</div>

Using MVPA, we found similar category (faces vs names) anticipation in both contexts. However, a classifier trained in one context was unable to generalize to the other! This, together with RSA suggests that **anticipating relevant vs probable information is context-specific**.

<div class="row" style="text-align: center;">
    <div class="col-sm mt-0 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/Fig3_chema.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    
</div>

All of this leads us to conclude that although humans are able to prepare efficiently for upcoming stimuli, they do so *differently* depending on their informational role. There are still lots of questions to answer, so stay tuned for more soon! üëÄüîç
