Do you want to know more about how to use MVPA to address the activation level of specific neural representations? ðŸ§  Check our new paper on **Canonical Template Tracking (CTT)** in Frontiers in Neuroimaging.

In this work, we described CTT: **a multivariate approach that estimates canonical neural representations (or templates) from localizer tasks**, to later track them in independent paradigmsâ€™ data using either RSA similarity measurements or machine learning classifiers.

Despite the previous use of CTT in [neuroimaging research](https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.3973) and its theoretical relevance for some [cognitive domains](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41583-022-00570-z), no methodological guidelines were yet available in the literature. We aimed to fill this gap!

In our paper, you will find **recommendations** on how to design localizer tasks from a multivariate perspective, a **step-by-step tutorial** on how to implement CTT analyses on spatial and temporally resolved datasets, and guidelines regarding results interpretation.

Do you want to give CTT a try? In the link below, youâ€™ll find Matlab **scripts** to perform different versions of the analysis on fMRI data. Also, the functions can be easily integrated in The Decoding Toolbox flow (check the analysis template).
